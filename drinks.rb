# You are working at a bar where you have a current backlog of drinks to make:
# 3 cocktails
# 2 waters
# and
# 6 beers

# Write a program that asks the customer for their order.
#   if they order a cocktail, add one to the number of cocktails you need to make,
#   if they order a water, add one to the number of waters you need to make,
#   if they order a beer, add one to the number of beers you need to pour

# Print the final drinks order so you know what to make

# Cocktails sell for $22, and cost $8 to make
# Beer sell for $12, and cost $3 to pour
# Water sell for $6, and cost $0.15 to make

# Print out the total profit for the orders you have
